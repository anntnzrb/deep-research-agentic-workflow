# Research Report: Software for Clothing Store Management System (consigna.pdf Assignment)

## 1. Project Objective

This document outlines the statistics and costs associated with the research conducted to fulfill the requirements of the `consigna.pdf` assignment. The assignment involved elaborating a structured specification for a generic requirement for software designed to solve a problem within the business model of a web/mobile system for Clothing Store Management.

## 2. Methodology

The research process involved the use of:

*   **Artificial Intelligence Model:** Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (model version 05-06) for analysis, generation, and synthesis of information.
*   **Web Search:** Brave Search MCP for gathering relevant data and examples from the web.

## 3. Statistics and Costs

### 3.1. Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API Usage

*   **Model:** Gemini 2.5 Pro 05-06
*   **Total Estimated Cost:** Approximately $9.00

**Pricing Details (per 1 Million tokens):**
*   Input Price: $2.50
*   Output Price: $15.00
*   Cache Reads Price: $0.63
*   Cache Writes Price: $4.50

### 3.2. Brave Search MCP API Usage

*   **Number of API Calls:** 11
*   **Cost:** $0.00
    *   *Note: The cost is $0 due to the Brave Search API's free tier, which provides 2000 free calls per month.*

## 4. File Metrics

The research generated a structured set of documents within the `research/` directory.

*   **Total Research Documents:** 25 Markdown files.
*   **Directory Breakdown:**
    *   `research/01_initial_queries/`: 3 files (Definición del Alcance, Preguntas Clave, Fuentes de Información)
    *   `research/02_data_collection/`: 8 files (Hallazgos Primarios, Secundarios, Perspectivas de Expertos, Ejemplos de Escenarios y Casos de Uso, Borrador de Diagrama)
    *   `research/03_analysis/`: 3 files (Patrones Identificados, Contradicciones Observadas, Brechas de Conocimiento)
    *   `research/04_synthesis/`: 3 files (Modelo Integrado, Ideas Clave, Aplicaciones Prácticas)
    *   `research/05_final_report/`: 8 files (Tabla de Contenidos, Resumen Ejecutivo, Metodología, Hallazgos Compilados, Análisis Profundo, Síntesis y Conclusiones, Recomendaciones, Referencias)

This organized structure facilitated a systematic approach to the research process, from initial queries to the final report compilation.

## 5. Personal Opinion on Research Process & Cost

I think the output generated during this research is of very high quality and offers significant value. I even believe it could be improved further with another round of recursive prompting research.

However, I find the associated cost (primarily from the Gemini 2.5 Pro API usage) to be somewhat elevated for a task of this nature (e.g., a simple homework assignment). For future similar endeavors, I believe exploring more cost-effective alternatives could be beneficial:

*   **Less Expensive Models:** In my opinion, models like Gemini 2.5 Flash might offer a better balance between performance and cost for such tasks.
*   **Locally Hosted LLMs:** I also think that for research involving extensive recursive prompting, locally hosted Large Language Models could provide a more budget-friendly solution, assuming the local infrastructure can support their operation effectively.

## 6. Conclusion

This report summarizes the resources utilized, their associated costs, the resulting file metrics, and a personal perspective on the research process for the `consigna.pdf` assignment. The combination of advanced AI model capabilities, targeted web searches, and a structured documentation approach facilitated the information gathering and analysis required for the project, with considerations for future cost optimization.
